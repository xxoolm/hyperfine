# v1.16.1

## Bugfixes

- Fix line-wrapping of `--help` text (@sharkdp)
- Fix `--input=null` (@sharkdp)


# v1.16.0

## Features

- Added new `--input` option, see #541 and #563 (@snease)

- On Windows, only run `cmd.exe` with the `/C` option. Use `-c` for all other shells.
  See #568 and #582 (@FilipAndersson245)

## Other

- Thanks to @berombau for working on dependency upgrades, see #584
- Fixed installationm on Windows, see #595 and #596 (@AntoniosBarotsis)


# v1.15.0

## Features

- Add new (experimental) `--min-benchmarking-time <secs>` option, see #527 (@sharkdp)

## Bugfixes

- Fix user and kernel times on Windows, see #368 and #538 (@clemenswasser)

## Other

- Improve `--help` texts of `--export-*` options, see #506 and #522 (@Engineer-of-Efficiency)


# v1.14.0

## Features

- Add a new `--output={null,pipe,inherit,<FILE>}` option to control
  where the output of the benchmarked program is redirected (if at all),
  see #377 and #509 (@tavianator, originally suggested by @BurntSushi)
- Add Emacs org-mode as a new export format, see #491 (@ppaulweber)


# v1.13.0

## Features

- Added a new `--shell=none`/`-N` option to disable the intermediate
  shell for executing the benchmarked commands. Hyperfine normally
  measures and subtracts the shell spawning time, but the intermediate
  shell always introduces a certain level of measurement noise. Using
  `--shell=none`/`-N` allows users to benchmark very fast commands
  (with a runtime on the order of a few milliseconds). See #336, #429,
  and #487 (@cipriancraciun and @sharkdp)
- Added `--setup`/`-s` option that can be used to run `make all` or
  similar. It runs once per set of tests, like `--cleanup`/`-c` (@avar)
- Added new `plot_progression.py` script to debug background interference
  effects.

## Changes

- Breaking change: the `-s` short option for `--style` is now used for
  the new `--setup` option.
- The environment offset randomization is now also available on Windows,
  see #484

## Other

- Improved documentation and test coverage, cleaned up code base for
  future improvements.


# v1.12.0

## Features

- `--command-name` can now take parameter names from `--parameter-*` options, see #351 and #391 (@silathdiir)
- Exit codes (or signals) are now printed in cases of command failures, see #342 (@KaindlJulian)
- Exit codes are now part of the JSON output, see #371 (@JordiChauzi)
- Colorized output should now be enabled on Windows by default, see #427

## Changes

- When `--export-*` commands are used, result files are created before benchmark execution
  to fail early in case of, e.g., wrong permissions. See #306 (@s1ck).
- When `--export-*` options are used, result files are written after each individual
  benchmark command instead of writing after all benchmarks have finished. See #306 (@s1ck).
- Reduce number of shell startup time measurements from 200 to 50, generally speeding up benchmarks. See #378
- User and system time are now in consistent time units, see #408 and #409 (@film42)



# v1.11.0

## Features

- The `-L`/`--parameter-list` option can now be specified multiple times to
  evaluate all possible combinations of the listed parameters:

  ``` bash
  hyperfine -L number 1,2 -L letter a,b,c \
      "echo {number}{letter}" \
      "printf '%s\n' {number}{letter}"
  # runs 12 benchmarks: 2 commands (echo and printf) times 6 combinations of
  # the "letter" and "number" parameters
  ```

  See: #253, #318 (@wchargin)

- Add CLI option to identify a command with a custom name, see #326 (@scampi)

## Changes

- When parameters are used with `--parameter-list` or `--parameter-scan`, the JSON export format
  now contains a dictionary `parameters` instead of a single key `parameter`. See #253, #318.
- The `plot_parametrized.py` script now infers the parameter name, and its `--parameter-name`
  argument has been deprecated. See #253, #318.

## Bugfixes

- Fix a bug in the outlier detection which would only detect "slow outliers" but not the fast
  ones (runs that are much faster than the rest of the benchmarking runs), see #329
- Better error messages for very fast commands that would lead to inf/nan results in the relative
  speed comparison, see #319
- Show error message if `--warmup` or `--*runs` arguments can not be parsed, see #337
- Keep output colorized when the output is not interactive and `--style=full` or `--style=color` is used.


# v1.10.0

## Features

- Hyperfine now comes with shell completion files for Bash, Zsh, Fish
  and PowerShell, see #290 (@four0000four).
- Hyperfine now comes with a basic man page, see #257 (@cadeef)
- During execution of benchmarks, hyperfine will now set a `HYPERFINE_RANDOMIZED_ENVIRONMENT_OFFSET` environment variable in order to randomize the memory layout. See #235 and #241 for references and details.
- A few enhancements for the histogram plotting scripts and the
  advanced statistics script
- Updates for the `plot_whisker.py` script, see #275 (@ghaiklor)

## Bugfixes

- Fix Spin Icon on Windows, see #229

Package authors: note that Hyperfine now comes with a set of shell completion files and a man page (see above)

# v1.9.0

## Features

- The new `--parameter-list <VAR> <VALUES>` option can be used to run
  a parametrized benchmark on a user-specified list of values.
  This is similar to `--parameter-scan <VAR> <MIN> <MAX>`, but doesn't
  necessarily required numeric arguments.

  ``` bash
  hyperfine --parameter-list compiler "gcc,clang" \
      "{compiler} -O2 main.cpp"
  ```

  See: #227, #234 (@JuanPotato)

- Added `none` as a possible choice for the `--style` option to
  run `hyperfine` without any output, see #193 (@knidarkness)

- Added a few new scripts for plotting various types of benchmark
  results (https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine/tree/master/scripts)

## Changes

- The `--prepare` command is now also run during the warmup
  phase, see #182 (@sseemayer)

- Better estimation of the remaining benchmark time due to an update
  of the `indicatif` crate.

## Other

- `hyperfine` is now available on NixOS, see #240 (@tuxinaut)

# v1.8.0

## Features

- The `--prepare <CMD>` option can now be specified multiple times to
  run specific preparation commands for each of the benchmarked programs:

  ``` bash
  hyperfine --prepare "make clean; git checkout master"  "make" \
            --prepare "make clean; git checkout feature" "make"
  ```

  See: #216, #218 (@iamsauravsharma)

- Added a new [`welch_ttest.py`](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine/blob/master/scripts/welch_ttest.py) script to test whether or not the two benchmark
  results are the same, see #222 (@uetchy)

- The Markdown export has been improved. The relative speed is now exported
  with a higher precision (see #208) and includes the standard deviation
  (see #225).

## Other

- Improved documentation for [`scripts`](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine/tree/master/scripts) folder (@matthieusb)

# v1.7.0

## Features

- Added a new `-D`,`--parameter-step-size` option that can be used to control
  the step size for `--parameter-scan` benchmarks. In addition, decimal numbers
  are now allowed for parameter scans. For example, the following command runs
  `sleep 0.3`, `sleep 0.5` and `sleep 0.7`:
  ``` bash
  hyperfine --parameter-scan delay 0.3 0.7 -D 0.2 'sleep {delay}'
  ```
  For more details, see #184 (@piyushrungta25)

- Enabled LTO for slightly smaller binary sizes, see #179 (@Calinou)
- Various small improvements all over the code base, see #194 (@phimuemue)

# v1.6.0

## Features

- Added a `-c, --cleanup <CMD>` option to execute `CMD` after the completion of all benchmarking runs for a given command. This is useful if the commands to be benchmarked produce artifacts that need to be cleaned up. See #91 (@RalfJung and @colinwahl)
- Add parameter values (for `--parameter-scan` benchmarks) to exported CSV and JSON files. See #131 (@bbannier)
- Added AsciiDoc export option, see #137 (@5paceToast)
